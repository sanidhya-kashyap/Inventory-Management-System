Foundations- In the foundations live workshops, the workshops are structured to teach you the basic motifs and foundations of that art style , the focus is not on completing a painting but the elements taught in each class are incorporated in a painting and a few different compositions are also taught
Advanced- in the Advanced live workshop, usually the focus is on completing a more elaborate and intricate painting - no basic motifs are covered in the advanced workshops.
Masterclass-A masterclass is structured as 7-8 pre-recorded classes covering introduction of the artform, introduction of the artist, introduction of the different traditional materials used in that art and then 3 artworks are usually taught ranging from beginner to intermediate."
