<div class="custom-accordian">
<button class="accordion">What is Kalamkari Art?</button>
<div class="panel">
  Kalamkari literally translates to ‘kalam’ meaning pen and ‘kaari’ meaning craftsmanship. Kalamkari is a hand-painted scroll painting that has been a part of Indian painting tradition for a long time. </p>
</div>     
  
  
<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Kalamkari art and where is Kalamkari Art from?</button>
<div class="panel">
  According to a few sources, Kalamkari has been practiced for about 3000 years now, although there is no evidence to substantiate this fact. The literary evidence states its first use was during the reign of Krishnadeva Raya from the Vijayanagara empire. It is the art of painting with a bamboo pen and natural dyes. Kalamkari flourished around and on the patronage of the temples. This gave the kalamkari paintings an almost religious identity in the form of temple scrolls, hangings, chariot banners etc.
  </div>

<button class="accordion">What are the main themes and motifs in Kalamkari art? </button>
<div class="panel">
Traditionally, themes from the epics and Puranas are depicted in Kalamkari paintings. The scrolls are depicted in a form of horizontal panels. The important episodes of the stories receive a larger layout. Along with the narrative stories, the kalamkari paintings also have a figurative depiction of the deities. Other themes of kalamkari paintings include the depiction of flowers, peacocks, paisleys, and other motifs inspired or directly derived from the Persian motifs. Today one of the most famous motifs is the tree of life, which symbolizes growth and prosperity.
</div>

<div class="custom-accordian">
<button class="accordion">What is Lippan Kaam?</button>
<div class="panel">
Chhittar Kaam is the mural tradition from the Kutch region in Gujarat. The craft form was traditionally done using the wild ass or camel dung, which means lippan in Gujarati, and hence its more famous name Lippan Kaam. The mud work, done in relief has been practiced by the various communities in the region.
  </div>
  
<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Lippan Kaam and where is it from?</button>
<div class="panel">
 The various communities migrated from the other side of the border in many waves, the latest being after the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971.
The major communities which practice Lippan kaam today are the Rebaris, the Harijans and the Mutwas, though there are many more sub-tribes which practice the craft. The Mutwa and Rebari community migrated from the Sindh to Kutch about 400 and 700 years ago respectively. While the Harijan community migrated from the Marwada region in Rajasthan. These communities primarily practice embroidery, pastoralism, livestock and horse rearing
</div>
  
<button class="accordion">What are the main themes and motifs in Lippan Kaam? </button>

The motifs are derived from everyday life with animals such as peacocks, camels, elephants, temples and geometric patterns. Each community has a distinct style of lippan and can be differentiated from the others.

Earlier, it used camel or wild ass dung and clay, but later the evolutionists used the husk of bajra as an alternative. Today the artists have shifted to using newspapers to avoid the pungent smell as well as to keep the termites away. The characteristic white colour of the Lippan kaam was earlier made using white clay or white sand from the Kutch. Today however, most artists use synthetic white paint.

<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Talapatra Art and where is it from?</button>
<div class="panel">
Talapatra Khodai from Odisha, as an art form, has shown the world that art is in no way limited.

  <button class="accordion">What are the different steps involved in making Talapatra paintings? </button>
<div class="panel">
The Palm leaves are dried under the sun for two to three months.  After being soaked in water they are further subjected to the treatment of a turmeric solution to make sure that they last longer.
After successfully drying up, they are finally ready to paint. They are tied together to make a scroll out of many palm leaves, a story is then drawn intricately onto the scroll. They are stitched in such a fine manner that it is impossible to make out that the scroll is made out of many leaves, appearing as if the scroll is all there is. The drawing is made with fine details as well, making sure even the smallest of the features are drawn correctly.

<button class="accordion">What are the main themes and motifs in Phulkari?</button>
<div class="panel">
The phulkari’s have intricate compositions with pleasing and harmonious colours. The designs are geometric and stylised.

<div class="panel">
Zardozi is a form of metal-thread embroidery most famous in the state of Lucknow. It is also practiced in parts of Farrukhabad, Chennai, and Bhopal It is a fine technique of embroidery which is used to add a touch of royalty to the fabric
  </div>  
  
<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Zardozi and where is it from?</button>
<div class="panel">
The embroidery originated in Persia and it translates to ‘zar’ which means gold and ‘dozi’ meaning embroidery.
Even though the Zardozi as we know it today has Persian roots, silver and gold thread weaving was also done in ancient India. According to some historians, the Hiranya, or the sacred gold cloth, is the present-day equivalent of the zari embroidery. The 6th-century Acharanga Sutra, sacred Jain literature mentions that gold-embroidered clothes should not be used by the monks. Marco Polo in the 13th century writes about the fabrics ‘skillfully embroidered with gold and silver wire’ from the Tamil-Pandya kingdom.
  </div> 
  
<button class="accordion">What are the main themes and motifs in Zardozi?</button>
<div class="panel">
The motifs are majorly based on nature, such as leaves, flowers, fruits, animals, and birds. One of the most common motifs is the mango, or kairi. Also common are geometrical patterns, jalis, paisleys inspired from the Persian designs.

  <button class="accordion">What are the different steps involved in Zardozi Embroidery?</button>
<div class="panel">
The required design is traced on a fabric. Usually, silk, organza, velvet, or satin is used for this process. The entire design is poked with a needle and then outlined. It is followed by fixing the fabric on the adda so that the fabric does not move. This requires the artists to keep the tools, needles, curved hooks, wires, threads, sequins, gems, beads at hand’s reach.

The zari for zardozi is made by flattening the gold and silver into wires called ‘badla’. It is then wrapped around silk threads. The resulting gold thread is also called sunehri, while the silver thread is called rupehri. </div> 
  
<button class="accordion">What are the different steps involved in Phulkari Embroidery?</button>
<div class="panel">
Zardozi traditionally uses threads made of gold, silver, or copper. The thread is held at the reverse side of the fabric, while the aari (needle) is held at the top. Along with the metallic threads, the craftsmen also use beads, pearls, sequins, precious and semi-precious stones to make intricate designs.

<h2 style="text-align:center">FAQs</h2>
      
<div class="custom-accordian">
<button class="accordion">What is Chikankari?</button>
<div class="panel">
The term chikankari is derived from the Persian word chikan, which means embroidery on garments and kari, which means work.
  </div>  
  
<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Chikankari and where is it from?</button>
<div class="panel">
There are no direct historical texts which document the arrival and development of chikankari in India. However, there are two different narratives as for its origin. The first and most famous narrative attributes its origins to the Mughal empress Noor Jahan which was later adopted by the Nawabs of Lucknow. While the second confers it to a sufi saint who taught the craft to a man in return for his hospitality. Yet another belief is that it originated in the East Bengal province, where chikan means fine.
  </div> 
  
<button class="accordion">What are the main themes and motifs in Chikankari?</button>
<div class="panel">
Inspiration for the various types of motifs comes from what the embroiders see around them, their local flora and fauna. Such as the chameli phool, karn phool or earrings, cowries, murri or puffed rice, dhaniya or coriander seeds, peepal leaves, lotus, marigold, lillies turank, akheri or paisley. The crescent moon is used for prayer caps and has religious significance. The motifs are also inspired from the mountains, rivers, tree of life among others. Local fauna has also inspired the chikankari motifs as seen in the depiction of realistic or symbolic fish, as well as peacocks. The local Islamic architecture inspired the embroiders to make intricate jail patterns on the fabric.

<button class="accordion">What is Pichwai Art?
</button>
<div class="panel">
The term Pichwai is a Hindi word, literally meaning “of behind “(pich-back and wai-of), a traditional art form practiced in Nathdwara, Rajasthan. The Pichwai is an intricate painting that depicts theatrical scenes from Lord Krishna’s life, typically hung behind the sanctum of his own manifestation, Shrinathji - the youthful manifestation of Krishna.
</div>  
  
<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Pichwai art and where is Pichwai Art from?
</button>
<div class="panel">
In the 15th century, perhaps as a reaction to the increasingly ascetic direction in which Hinduism was going, there was born in North India, a new off-set of Krishna worship called the Pushti Marg, or the Path of Grace. Due to its philosophical belief of monism, the Pushti Marg maintains that all existence is derived from a single Supreme Power and that all living beings carry its essence within them. Pushti which means God’s grace and lila meaning the revelation of himself in his divine play is where Bhakti lies, the path to the adoration of Krishna. According to the popular legend, Krishna as a child lifted the Govardhan Parvat on his little finger to save the villagers of Vrindavan from the thunderstorms and flood. This episode is of crucial relevance to this artform and depicted as Shrinathji, the childhood form of Lord Krishna. The main Pushti Marg swaroop (form) of Shrinathji represents Krishna at the age of seven.

Creating a pichwai can take several months, and requires immense skill, as the smallest details need to be painted with precision. The themes vary from Lord Krishna childhood tales, Radha Krishna paintings and various festivals celebrating Krishna, like Janmashtami, Govardhan Puja, Sharad Purnima, Holi, Annakut etc. Although most pichwais feature Krishna in his various swaroops, particularly those of childhood and adolescence, and primarily that of Shrinathji, some hangings and paintings also feature other important figures in the Pushti Marg pantheon or history, including specific goswamis or priests.

</div>  
  
<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Thangka art and where is Thangka Art from?

</button>
<div class="panel">
The Tibetan Thangka painting finds its roots from the folk arts of pata and mandala. Even with its Indian base, it reached its zenith under the Nepalese and the Chinese artists. In the 7th century, buddhism developed as an art form under the reign of Songsten Gampo. His atelier included both Nepalese and Chinese artists and developed a style which included elements from both. During the 11th century, the Kashmiri monk Rinchen Zangpo introduced artists from Kashmir to Tibet. Together the Thangka painting was influenced by the central Indian, Kashmiri, Nepalese and its own indigenous art style which continued well into the 17th century. From the beginnings of the 18th century, the Chinese influence on the painting tradition also started to be felt.

<button class="accordion">What are the different styles of Thangka art?</button>
<div class="panel">
The three major Tibetan painting styles are Menri, Mensar and Karma Gadri. Since the Thangka paintings are governed by the iconographic rules, the three styles can be differentiated by their backgrounds. Menri style includes the representation of nature in a flow with much less focus on the details. The Mensar school is characterised by the details and round, thick clouds. The karma gadri paintings are not as prevalent today as the other two. They are depicted in a realistic manner and are not stylised. There is a lot of open space and the green colour pre-dominates.

<button class="accordion">What are the different steps involved in Thangka  art?
</button>
<div class="panel">
The first stage in any Thangka are the central lines. The central vertical line is the most important axis. It forms the centre of the composition and the main figure. There are 8 major lines: 2 diagonals, the vertical and horizontal axis, the four outer borders. The deities are arranged according to the buddhist tradition in the order of: buddhas, boddhisattvas, goddesses, wrathful figures, and humans. Once the figures are drawn, the surrounding elements are made.
The paint is first applied to the background elements and then moved towards the main figures. Paints are applied one at a time and the lighter shades are applied first. The basic sequence of colours is blue, green, red, orange, yellow, ochre, brown, pink, white and gold. Once the initial layer of paint has dried, the Thangka is painted. There are two methods of shading: dry and wet. The outlining of the Thangka is done in the end. The colours for outlines vary according to the paint applied, from indigo to white.

<button class="accordion">What kind of colours and materials are used in Thangka art?

<div class="panel">
Since Thangka is a piece of meditation, there is a set of rules and instructions that are to be followed before the artist begins painting it. Traditionally there are a lot of rules such as abstaining from meat, onion and garlic, alcohol, etc. However, in the most basic sense, it requires us to have a clean and pure mind, body and surrounding. While painting a Thangka, one should abstain from having impure thoughts. The most common way of doing this is by meditating.

Before the actual process of painting even begins, the artist has to start with the preparation of the canvas on which the painting will take place: the cloth. The cloth is coated with the stone powder of chalk and glue made using tamarind seeds. This is done to give it a soft, smooth finish, making it strong and semi absorbent for the paint.
A rough sketch of the painting is then made using a brush. The colours to be used majorly in the painting are further applied- they consist of yellow,black, white and red. All these colours are naturally sourced-  Red from the shingle stone, Yellow from haritala stone, White from crushed, boiled, and filtered shells and Black is prepared out of lampblack.
After the colours are filled in, the artists use a black brush to create fine strokes for the finishing. To make the painting durable and water resistant, it is held over a charcoal fire and lacquer is applied to the surface.

</div>    
<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Sanjhi art and where is Sanjhi Art from?
</button>
<div class="panel">
The craft of Sanjhi originated as a folk art form practiced by the unmarried girls for a good husband and children. The folk tradition involves the creation of Sanjhi on the walls using stones and mirrors on a cow dung base.
Eventually with the rise of Vallabhacharya sect and the growth of Bhakti movement in North India in the 15th an 16th century, the craft came to be associated with Vaishnavas in the form of temple traditions. It takes it roots back to the divine relationship of Radha-Krishna. Hence, the two traditions of Sanjhi are folk tradition and temple tradition.

Miniature paintings originated in India around 750 A.D when the Palas ruled over the eastern part of India.

With the rise of the Mughal Empire, miniature paintings started growing on a level unknown before. Thanks to Akbar’s love for art, Indian miniature paintings combined elements of Persian style of painting, to give rise to the Mughal style of painting.

The Kalighat paintings developed in the 19th century in the Bengal presidency. The travelling scroll painters or the patuas had been practising folk art of Pattachitra. The new manners and customs of the British settlers, the revivalist exercises of the Mughal and theatres as well as the use of Sanskrit on stage was absorbed by the rural artists who had migrated to Calcutta and developed it into a popular urban genre.

<div class="panel">
The artists primarily depicted what surrounded the artists. Their dietary practices made fish a recurring and common motif in the paintings. Another important element in the Kalighat paintings was the cat. Paintings depicting Cat with a Fish depict the religious hypocrisy, where the cat is a satirical representation of the false aesthetic. The artists also painted the religious figures such as Durga, episodes from the epics, and other sacred texts. Many paintings commented on the priests, perhaps depicting the social customs that prevailed during that period. Babus with their hair groomed in the Albert style, wearing expensive shawls and buckled shoes, smoking their hookahs and sitting on Victorian chairs was a common depiction.

<button class="accordion">What is Bengal Pattachitra art?

Literally meaning a ‘painting done on cloth’, Pattachitra mainly hails from the state of Odisha.</div>    
<button class="accordion">What is the origin of Bengal Pattachitra art and where is it from?
</button>
<div class="panel">
Historically, Pattachitra came into existence in order to depict Lord Jagannath’s tales. Krishna’s leelas have been an important motif for the paintings as well. Thus, the main themes of Pattachitra revolve around religious narratives, mythological stories and folktales.

The artiste caste of Odisha, the Mahapatras or Maharanas originally began to engage themselves in this art.

<button class="accordion">What are the different steps involved in Bengal Pattachitra art?

<div class="panel">
Before the actual process of painting even begins, the artist has to start with the preparation of the canvas on which the painting will take place: the cloth. The cloth is coated with the stone powder of chalk and glue made using tamarind seeds. This is done to give it a soft, smooth finish, making it strong and semi absorbent for the paint.
A rough sketch of the painting is then made using a brush. The colours to be used majorly in the painting are further applied- they consist of yellow,black, white and red. All these colours are naturally sourced-  Red from the shingle stone, Yellow from haritala stone, White from crushed, boiled, and filtered shells and Black is prepared out of lampblack.
After the colours are filled in, the artists use a black brush to create fine strokes for the finishing. To make the painting durable and water resistant, it is held over a charcoal fire and lacquer is applied to the surface.
